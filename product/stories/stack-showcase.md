# Story: Stack showcase (tools and why)

As a visitor, I want to see the analytics and experimentation tools you recommend and why, so that I can evaluate your approach.

- Priority: P1
- Estimate: 0.5â€“1 day
- Status: Planned
- Related feature: `product/features/analytics-architecture.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given the Stack page/section Then I see tools grouped by function (collection, storage, modeling, viz, experimentation, consent)
- Given each tool Then I see a short rationale and privacy note

## Tasks

- [ ] Define the canonical tool list and rationale (2h)
- [ ] Implement grouped list with anchors and external links (2h)

## Definition of Done

- Stack documented, links validated, content clear and skimmable
