# Story: Clear CTAs to Contact/Book (Dropped)

As a prospective client, I want obvious CTAs to contact or book a call, so that I can engage without friction.

- Priority: P1
- Estimate: 0.5 day
- Status: Dropped (not applicable)
- Related feature: `product/features/services.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given the Services page Then I see a primary CTA (Contact/Book) on the page and in the sticky header/footer
- Given mobile Then the CTA is visible without excessive scroll

## Tasks

- [ ] Decide contact method (form/email) and/or Calendly/booking link (1h)
- [ ] Implement CTA components and sticky affordance (2h)

## Notes

- Services CTAs were dropped with the removal of the Services page. The site retains a global Contact CTA with tracking data attributes.
