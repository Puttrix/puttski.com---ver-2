Reliable analytics starts with a clear data model and responsible consent.

1. Define events and properties before implementation.
2. Prefer privacy‑by‑design collection.
3. Document decisions and changes for future you.

> Matomo‑first; GA4/GTM and PostHog where appropriate.

```js
// Minimal event shape example
const event = {
  name: 'cta_click',
  props: { label: 'contact', location: 'hero' }
}
```
